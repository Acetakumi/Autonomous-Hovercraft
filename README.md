# 🚁 Autonomous Hovercraft Navigation System

> Team engineering project focused on building an autonomous hovercraft capable of navigating a maze and stopping precisely under a target bar using embedded systems and real-time control.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an **autonomous hovercraft** controlled by an **ATmega328P microcontroller**. The system uses multiple sensors to perceive its environment and make real-time navigation decisions while maintaining stable hover, steering, and thrust control.

The hovercraft successfully navigates a maze, avoids obstacles, and stops accurately at a defined end condition.
